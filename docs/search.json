    "text": "Overview\nSPO-14582: Data Analysis is a seminar offered in the M.Sc. Sport Science for Health at the University of Konstanz. It provides an introduction to data analysis using the statistical programming software R. Students will learn the basics of R programming and how to use R for common data analysis tasks.\n\n\nClass Meetings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      When\n      What\n      Topic\n      Who\n    \n  \n  \n    Apr 11\nLec-1\nIntroduction to R and RStudio\n \n    Apr 18\nExc-1\nExercise\n\n    Apr 25\nLec-2\nScalars and Vectors\n\n    May 2\nExc-2\nExercise\n\n    May 9\n⛱️\nHoliday\n\n    May 16\nLec-3\nWhen\n\n    May 23\nExc-3\nExercise\n\n    May 30\n⛱️\nHoliday\n\n    Jun 6\nLec-4\nData Management\n\n    Jun 13\nExc-4\nExercise\n\n    Jun 20\nLec-5\nData Exploration and Visualization\n\n    Jun 27\nExc-5\nExercise\n\n    Jul 4\nLec-6\nStatistical Analysis and Inference\n\n    Jul 11\nExc-6\nExercise\n\n    Jul 18\n\nOral Exam\n \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching Team\n\nDr. Maik Bieleke is senior researcher and data scientist at the department of sport science at the University of Konstanz.

It consists of eight items that tap into two important aspects of implementation intentions: whether an individual identifies critical obstacles and opportunities (e.g., going to the cafeteria) and specifies corresponding goal-directed behaviors (e.g., grabbing an apple)."

The items might be presented in random order to avoid order effects. Participants rate each of the eight items on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).\n\n\nInstruction\nThe ITPS has been developed as a domain-general measure of if-then planning. Accordingly, the instruction refers to goals in general and not to a specific goal. The focus is on difficult and important goals as only these goals require if-then planning to facilitate goal attainment. However, the instruction can in principle also be tailored to specific goals (e.g., health goals, learning goals) if the focus is on if-then planning in a particular domain.\n\n\nScoring and interpretation\nAn overall score is obtained by averaging a participant’s ratings across all eight items. All items are formulated in the same direction so that no reverse-coding is neccessary. A higher ITPS score indicates a greater propensity to engage in if-then planning.\nNote that although the ITPS is composed of different subscales (e.g., thinking about potential obstacles), subscale scores should only be used for explorative analyses. In general, it is recommended to interpret the overall ITPS score."
